### Description

This is a calculator made in VB6. It does a lot of useful functions such as circle area and circumference, support of minus numbers. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of numbers. It als does some more advanced functions found on a calculator.

Now fixed the error with division by zero

and added a calculator history with news

about previous versions. Please leave

comments and vote if you like this program.

Now I have made sure the div by 0 error is

fixed! Added some improved code and a few

more things to improve the program. If you

have any problems with this program, please

email me or leave some comments here,

describing the problem. Now added a host of

new functions to the calculator. Sin, Cos

and Tan. Abs function, support for fractions.

There are loads of new features. You can

also store a number in temporary memory as

well.
